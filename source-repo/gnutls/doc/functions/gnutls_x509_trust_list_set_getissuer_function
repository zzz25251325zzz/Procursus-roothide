@deftypefun {void} {gnutls_x509_trust_list_set_getissuer_function} (gnutls_x509_trust_list_t          @var{tlist}, gnutls_x509_trust_list_getissuer_function          * @var{func})
@var{tlist}: is a @code{gnutls_x509_trust_list_t}  type.

@var{func}: is the callback function

This function sets a callback to be called when the peer's certificate
chain is incomplete due a missing intermediate certificate. The callback
may provide the missing certificate for use during verification.

The callback's function prototype is defined in gnutls/x509.h as:

int (*callback)(gnutls_x509_trust_list_t list,
const gnutls_x509_crt_t cert,
gnutls_x509_crt_t **issuers,
unsigned int *issuers_size);

If the callback function is provided then gnutls will call it during the
certificate verification procedure. The callback may wish to use
@code{gnutls_x509_crt_get_authority_info_access()}  to get a URI from which
to attempt to download the missing issuer certificate, if available.

On a successful call, the callback shall allocate the 'issuers' array with
@code{gnutls_x509_crt_list_import2()} . The ownership of both the array and the
elements is transferred to the caller and thus the application does not need
to maintain the memory after the call.

The callback function should return 0 if the missing issuer certificate
for 'crt' was properly populated and added to the 'issuers', or non-zero
to continue the certificate list verification but with issuer as @code{NULL} .
